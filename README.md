3 Project Ideas for Springboard CAPSTONE Project. 

Capstone Project Ideas

1) Optimizing a portfolio of stocks in the Tech sector using Machine Learning.
	- Try and predict future prices of stocks using various key financial data. The datasets can be found at Quandl or Yahoo Finance. 
	- Use different algorithms and build a portfolio of stocks with the data and results. 
	- Use basic finance techniques to build a model that will take into account serveral factors or techniques (ensamble)
	- Also try and use machine learning to create a high frequency trading strategy that would take Order State Data and again try to build mode with different methods learned in the course to predict near future price fluctatations. 

2) Predicting Currency Fluctuations with Machine Learning. 
	- Predict currency fluctuations through Economic data like GDP, Population, Employment, Inflation, and Macro Indicators. 
	- Data sets can be found at Quandl

3) Predicting Credit Risk and Default using Machine Learning
	-  Predicting chance of someone defaulting on their credit, mortgages, credit cards ect.
	- Not 100% sure where this data can be found. 
	- Possible a better idea would be trying to predict fraud as thier are data sets on this aswell.
